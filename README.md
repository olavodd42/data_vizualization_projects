# Data Visualization Projects

This repository contains several data visualization projects that analyze various datasets using interactive notebooks and Python scripts.

## Projects Overview

### Airline Analysis
- **Description:** Analyzes airline data including miles, number of passengers, delays, and in-flight services (meal, entertainment, WiFi).
- **File:** [Airline Analysis Notebook](Airline%20Analysis/Airline%20Analysis.ipynb)

### Exploring Mushrooms
- **Description:** Explores a dataset of mushrooms, focusing on the categorization of mushroom features. The project uses visualizations such as bar charts to represent categorical data.
- **File:** [Exploring Mushrooms Notebook](Exploring%20Mushrooms/Exploring%20Mushrooms.ipynb)
- **Additional:** Includes solution and checkpoint notebooks in the `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder.

### Sublime Limes Line Graph
- **Description:** Contains a Python script that generates a line graph, likely as part of a data visualization exercise.
- **File:** [script.py](Sublime_Limes_Line_Graph/script.py)

## How to Run

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Open the `.ipynb` files in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) to run the analyses.
- **Python Script:** Ensure you have Python installed, then execute the script via the command line:

```sh
